Hi **SUSD**,

Seems like you found our little thing. Welcome. We want to notify you that you can't legally do anything about are operations. Heres why:


##Educational Purposes only.
As mentioned in your Code of Condcut all sites visited must be "educational purposes only". We claim that our site is Educational Purposes only for
demostration. We never have promoted or will ever promote using this inside of any of SUSD schools.

## Operations
While we do understand your right to shutdown things operated inside SUSD/MMS. We are operating outside of SUSD as a branch of a group
outside of "SUSD". This means we can continue to operate

##Thanks
Thanks for making us do this
